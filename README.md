see the html document deployed by github on:

https://yahya-tamur.github.io/visualizing-complex-functions-2/doc/a.html

in progress. rewrite of older project I had.

goals:

  - create gifs to display the complex functions (similar to older project)
  - (done?) maybe add domain coloring + black to white images
  - make gif of sphere with stereographic projection
  
that's it?
    
  - rayon to parallelize
  - for the rust project, one library file + separate binary for each image
  - (done?) htlatex for compiling latex into html
  - short writeup, like 5 pages max?
