in progress. rewrite of older project I had.

goals:

  - create 2d complex gifs
  - maybe add domain coloring + black to white images
  - make spheres
  - that's it?
  - rayon to parallelize
  - for the rust project, one library file + separate binary for each image

  - htlatex for compiling into html
  - maybe like 5 pages max?
